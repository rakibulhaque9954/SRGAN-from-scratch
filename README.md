# SRGAN-from-scratch
 Creating an SRGAN model based on a research paper
 Training with 12500 images for over 9 epochs led to significant training results, but superres still needs more training and data

PSNR Value recevied was: 28.5 which is pretty close to 30 which shows that the Superresolved Image was close in terms of quality.


Another result for training over 3 days with 25000 images PSNR was improved to 29.35
